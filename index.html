<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
  This two-day hands-on bootcamp will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

    Modify this block to reflect the target audience for your bootcamp.
    In particular, if it is only open to people from a particular institution,
    or if specialized prerequisite knowledge is required, please mention that.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at postgraduate students, post-docs and other researchers who have a basic familiarity 
  with programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and arrays, but need help to translate this knowledge 
  into practical tools to help them work more productively. We particularly encourage researchers
  attending <a href="http://2014.pycon-au.org/">PyCon Australia</a> to extend their stay in order to participate 
  in the bootcamp.

  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
  Participants are asked to bring a laptop with some specific
  software packages installed (see Setup instructions below). If you don't have a laptop,
  that's completely fine. We'll pair you up with someone who does.
</p>
<p>
  Participants are also asked to fill out a
  short questionnaire about their previous programming experience. The responses will be used to tailor the
  teaching material to the knowledge base of the audience. We will send the short questionnaire via email two weeks
  before the bootcamp.
